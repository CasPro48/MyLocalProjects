Assume standard enterprise security controls are in place.", "output": "Technique overview: Adversaries may use network logon scripts automatically executed at logon initialization to establish persistence. Network logon scripts can be assigned using Active Directory or Group Policy Objects. These logon scripts run with the privileges of the user they are assigned to. Depending on the systems within the network, initializing one of these scripts could apply to more than one or potentially all systems. Adversaries may use these scripts to maintain persistence on a network. Depending on the access configuration of the logon scripts, either local credentials or an administrator account may be necessary. This technique serves the persistence, privilege-escalation phase(s). Consider sequencing with complementary techniques for a complete attack chain."}
{"instruction": "Analyze the use of Launch Agent technique in a penetration test.", "input": "Target environment: macOS. Attack phase: persistence, privilege-escalation. Assume standard enterprise security controls are in place.", "output": "Technique overview: Adversaries may create or modify launch agents to repeatedly execute malicious payloads as part of persistence. When a user logs in, a per-user launchd process is started which loads the parameters for each launch-on-demand user agent from the property list (.plist) file found in <code>/System/Library/LaunchAgents</code>, <code>/Library/LaunchAgents</code>, and <code>~/Library/LaunchAgents</code>. Property list files use the <code>Label</code>, <code>ProgramArguments </code>, and <code>RunAtLoad</code> keys to identify the Launch Agent's name, executable location, and execution time. Launch Agents are often installed to perform updates to programs, launch user specified programs at login, or to conduct other developer tasks. Launch Agents can also be executed using the Launchctl command. A This technique serves the persistence, privilege-escalation phase(s).

{"instruction": "Analyze the use of Create Account technique in a penetration test.", "input": "Target environment: Windows, IaaS, Linux, macOS, Network Devices, Containers, SaaS, Office Suite, Identity Provider, ESXi. Attack phase: persistence. Assume standard enterprise security controls are in place.", "output": "Technique overview: Adversaries may create an account to maintain access to victim systems. With a sufficient level of access, creating such accounts may be used to establish secondary credentialed access that do not require persistent remote access tools to be deployed on the system. Accounts may be created on the local system or within a domain or cloud tenant. In cloud environments, adversaries may create accounts that only have access to specific services, which can reduce the chance of detection. This technique serves the persistence phase(s).

Assume standard enterprise security controls are in place.", "output": "Technique overview: Adversaries may add or modify XDG Autostart Entries to execute malicious programs or commands when a user\u2019s desktop environment is loaded at login. XDG Autostart entries are available for any XDG-compliant Linux system. XDG Autostart entries use Desktop Entry files () to configure the user\u2019s desktop environment upon user login. These configuration files determine what applications launch upon user login, define associated applications to open specific file types, and define applications used to open removable media. Adversaries may abuse this feature to establish persistence by adding a path to a malicious binary or command to the directive in the configuration file. When the user\u2019s desktop environment is loaded at user login, the files located in the XDG Autostart directories are automati This technique serves the persistence, privilege-escalation phase(s).

{"instruction": "Analyze the use of Re-opened Applications technique in a penetration test.", "input": "Target environment: macOS. Attack phase: persistence, privilege-escalation. Assume standard enterprise security controls are in place.", "output": "Technique overview: Adversaries may modify plist files to automatically run an application when a user logs in. When a user logs out or restarts via the macOS Graphical User Interface (GUI), a prompt is provided to the user with a checkbox to \"Reopen windows when logging back in\". When selected, all applications currently open are added to a property list file named <code>com.apple.loginwindow.[UUID].plist</code> within the <code>~/Library/Preferences/ByHost</code> directory. Applications listed in this file are automatically reopened upon the user\u2019s next logon. Adversaries can establish Persistence by adding a malicious application path to the <code>com.apple.loginwindow.[UUID].plist</code> file to execute payloads when a user logs in. This technique serves the persistence, privilege-escalation phase(s). Consider sequencing with complementary techniques for a complete attack chain."}

Assume standard enterprise security controls are in place.", "output": "Technique overview: Adversaries may use Windows logon scripts automatically executed at logon initialization to establish persistence. Windows allows logon scripts to be run whenever a specific user or group of users log into a system. This is done via adding a path to a script to the <code>HKCU\\Environment\\UserInitMprLogonScript</code> Registry key. Adversaries may use these scripts to maintain persistence on a single system.

{"instruction": "Analyze the use of vSphere Installation Bundles technique in a penetration test.", "input": "Target environment: ESXi. Attack phase: persistence. Assume standard enterprise security controls are in place.", "output": "Technique overview: Adversaries may abuse vSphere Installation Bundles (VIBs) to establish persistent access to ESXi hypervisors. VIBs are collections of files used for software distribution and virtual system management in VMware environments. Since ESXi uses an in-memory filesystem where changes made to most files are stored in RAM rather than in persistent storage, these modifications are lost after a reboot. However, VIBs can be used to create startup tasks, apply custom firewall rules, or deploy binaries that persist across reboots. Typically, administrators use VIBs for updates and system maintenance. VIBs can be broken down into three components: * VIB payload: a archive containing the directories and files to be created and executed on boot when the VIBs are loaded. * Signature file: verifies the host This technique serves the persistence phase(s).

{"instruction": "Analyze the use of Dylib Hijacking technique in a penetration test.", "input": "Target environment: macOS. Attack phase: persistence, privilege-escalation, defense-evasion. Assume standard enterprise security controls are in place.", "output": "Technique overview: Adversaries may execute their own payloads by placing a malicious dynamic library (dylib) with an expected name in a path a victim application searches at runtime. The dynamic loader will try to find the dylibs based on the sequential order of the search paths. Paths to dylibs may be prefixed with <code>@rpath</code>, which allows developers to use relative paths to specify an array of search paths used at runtime based on the location of the executable. Additionally, if weak linking is used, such as the <code>LC_LOAD_WEAK_DYLIB</code> function, an application will still execute even if an expected dylib is not present. Weak linking enables developers to run an application on multiple macOS versions as new APIs are added. Adversaries may gain execution by inserting malicious dylibs with th This technique serves the persistence, privilege-escalation, defense-evasion phase(s).

Assume standard enterprise security controls are in place.", "output": "Technique overview: Adversaries may leverage the COR_PROFILER environment variable to hijack the execution flow of programs that load the .NET CLR. The COR_PROFILER is a .NET Framework feature which allows developers to specify an unmanaged (or external of .NET) profiling DLL to be loaded into each .NET process that loads the Common Language Runtime (CLR). These profilers are designed to monitor, troubleshoot, and debug managed code executed by the .NET CLR. The COR_PROFILER environment variable can be set at various scopes (system, user, or process) resulting in different levels of influence. System and user-wide environment variable scopes are specified in the Registry, where a Component Object Model (COM) object can be registered as a profiler DLL. A process scope COR_PROFILER can also be created in-memory This technique serves the persistence, privilege-escalation, defense-evasion phase(s).
