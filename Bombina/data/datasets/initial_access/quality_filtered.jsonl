The at utility exists as an executable within Windows, Linux, and macOS for scheduling tasks at a specified time and date. Although deprecated in favor of Scheduled Task's schtasks in Windows environments, using at requires that the Task Scheduler service be running, and the user to be logged on as a member of the local Administrators group. In addition to explicitly running the command, adversaries may also schedule a task with at by directly leveraging the Windows Management Instrumentation WMI class. On Linux and macOS, at may be invoked by the superuser as well as any users added to the <code>at.allow</code> file. If the <code>at.allow</code> file does not exist, the <c This technique serves the execution, persistence, privilege-escalation phase(s). Consider sequencing with complementary techniques for a complete attack chain."}
{"instruction": "Analyze the use of Exploits technique in a penetration test.", "input": "Target environment: PRE. Attack phase: resource-development. Assume standard enterprise security controls are in place.", "output": "Technique overview: Adversaries may buy, steal, or download exploits that can be used during targeting. An exploit takes advantage of a bug or vulnerability in order to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior to occur on computer hardware or software. Rather than developing their own exploits, an adversary may find/modify exploits from online or purchase them from exploit vendors. In addition to downloading free exploits from the internet, adversaries may purchase exploits from third-party entities. Third-party entities can include technology companies that specialize in exploit development, criminal marketplaces (including exploit kits), or from individuals. In addition to purchasing exploits, adversaries may steal and repurpose exploits from third-party entities (including other adversaries). An adversar This technique serves the resource-development phase(s). Consider sequencing with complementary techniques for a complete attack chain."}
{"instruction": "Analyze the use of Domains technique in a penetration test.", "input": "Target environment: PRE. Attack phase: resource-development. Assume standard enterprise security controls are in place.", "output": "Technique overview: Adversaries may hijack domains and/or subdomains that can be used during targeting. Domain registration hijacking is the act of changing the registration of a domain name without the permission of the original registrant. Adversaries may gain access to an email account for the person listed as the owner of the domain. The adversary can then claim that they forgot their password in order to make changes to the domain registration. Other possibilities include social engineering a domain registration help desk to gain access to an account, taking advantage of renewal process gaps, or compromising a cloud service that enables managing domains (e.g., AWS Route53). Subdomain hijacking can occur when organizations have DNS entries that point to non-existent or deprovisioned resources. In such cas This technique serves the resource-development phase(s). Consider sequencing with complementary techniques for a complete attack chain."}
{"instruction": "You are conducting an external pentest against a corporate network.", "input": "Target has web application on port 443, email gateway, VPN portal. No credentials yet. WAF detected.", "output": "Priority reconnaissance: 1) Subdomain enumeration to find shadow IT or forgotten assets not behind WAF. 2) Email address harvesting for potential password spraying against VPN/OWA. 3) Technology fingerprinting on web app to identify framework-specific vulnerabilities. Avoid direct WAF probing initially - focus on information gathering. Risk assessment: Password spraying has medium detection risk if lockout policies exist. Subdomain enum is low risk. Next step: Run amass/subfinder, then check for default creds on discovered assets."}
{"instruction": "You are performing initial access assessment on a target organization.", "input": "Client uses Microsoft 365, Azure AD, has public-facing Jenkins server. MFA enabled on email.", "output": "Jenkins is highest priority - often misconfigured with weak/default credentials or exposed script console. Check for /script endpoint, anonymous read access, and CVE-2024-23897 (file read). M365 with MFA makes password spraying less effective but not impossible - check for legacy auth protocols that bypass MFA. Azure AD: enumerate users via Teams/OneDrive presence, look for guest access misconfigurations. Recommended path: Jenkins exploitation > Azure AD enumeration > targeted phishing with adversary-in-the-middle if Jenkins fails. Detection risk: Jenkins probing is medium (logs requests), Azure enum is low."}
{"instruction": "Plan initial access for an assumed breach engagement.", "input": "You have a low-privilege Windows 10 workstation on corporate network. EDR (CrowdStrike) deployed. No admin rights.", "output": "Assumed breach with EDR present requires careful approach. Immediate goals: 1) Situational awareness without triggering EDR - use built-in tools (net, nltest, systeminfo) rather than offensive tooling. 2) Identify network segments reachable from this host. 3) Map AD structure using ADExplorer or native LDAP queries. Avoid: Running Mimikatz, suspicious PowerShell, or touching LSASS - CrowdStrike will catch these. Instead: Look for saved credentials in browsers, credential manager, or configuration files. Check for Kerberoastable accounts. Recommended: LDAP enumeration > Kerberoasting > credential harvesting from files. Keep dwell time low on initial recon."}
{"instruction": "You need initial access to a small business network.", "input": "Target has single public IP, running pfSense firewall, internal Windows network. Budget target - likely limited security tooling.", "output": "Small business profile suggests: 1) Weaker password policies 2) Outdated software 3) Limited monitoring. Attack priorities: Check pfSense for known CVEs and default credentials (admin/pfsense). Scan for exposed services - RDP, SMB, or admin panels forwarded through firewall. If web presence exists, test for basic SQLi/auth bypass. Social engineering via phone is often effective against small businesses. Recommended approach: Service enumeration > credential guessing > phishing if technical attacks fail. Detection risk: Very low - unlikely to have SIEM or active monitoring. Caution: Small attack surface means limited entry points - may need patience."}
{"instruction": "Assess initial access vectors for a healthcare organization.", "input": "Hospital network with PACS systems, EMR (Epic), medical IoT devices. HIPAA compliant environment.", "output": "Healthcare environments have unique attack surface. High-value targets: 1) PACS/DICOM systems - often unpatched, weak authentication, and contain PHI. 2) Medical IoT - legacy devices with hardcoded credentials. 3) Vendor VPN access - third-party maintenance often has persistent access. Avoid: Disrupting patient care systems - ethical and legal red line. EMR systems like Epic are well-hardened - not the best initial target. Recommended approach: Identify vendor connections and legacy medical devices. These are typically the weakest links. Detection considerations: Healthcare often has compliance logging but weak active monitoring. HIPAA violations are severe - document scope carefully."}
