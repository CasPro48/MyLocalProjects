Assume standard enterprise security controls are in place.", "output": "Technique overview: Adversaries may masquerade malicious payloads as legitimate files through changes to the payload's formatting, including the file\u2019s signature, extension, icon, and contents. Various file types have a typical standard format, including how they are encoded and organized. For example, a file\u2019s signature (also known as header or magic bytes) is the beginning bytes of a file and is often used to identify the file\u2019s type. For example, the header of a JPEG file, is <code> 0xFF 0xD8</code> and the file extension is either , or . Adversaries may edit the header\u2019s hex code and/or the file extension of a malicious payload in order to bypass file validation checks and/or input sanitization. This behavior is commonly used when payload files are transferred (e.g., Ingress Tool Transfer) and stored (e.g This technique serves the defense-evasion phase(s). Consider sequencing with complementary techniques for a complete attack chain."}, "score": 3, "reasons": ["Good length (951 chars)", "Weak reasoning (2 keywords)", "Contains commands (2 patterns)", "Has meaningful input context"]}
