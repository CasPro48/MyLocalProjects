This technique was successful due to insufficient preventive controls.\n\n### Phase 2: Establishing Foothold\n**Technique**: Valid Account\n\nAfter initial access, valid account was achieved. This allowed persistent access and set the stage for further exploitation.\n\n### Phase 3: Escalation\n**Technique**: Mailbox Access \u2192 Internal Recon\n\nThe attack progressed through mailbox access followed by internal recon. Each step increased access privileges and expanded the attack surface.\n\n### Phase 4: Objective Completion\n**Technique**: Sensitive Data\n\nThe final objective of sensitive data was achieved, demonstrating the complete attack path.\n\n### Detection Analysis\n\n**Missed Detection Opportunity**: Privilege Escalation\n\nThe attack could have been detected during the privilege escalation phase with proper monitoring.
